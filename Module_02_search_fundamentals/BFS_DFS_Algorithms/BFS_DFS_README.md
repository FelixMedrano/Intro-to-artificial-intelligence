These search algorithms were developed by Rishal Hurbans for Grokkings 'Artificial Intelligence Algorithms' 
All that was done was implementing the algorithms into a single file, making it repeatable and giving the user the ability
to choose between which algorithm they would like to run, BFS or DFS
