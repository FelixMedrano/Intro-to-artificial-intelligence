This assignment runs the search algorithms: A*, BFS, and DFS as well as runs a tic-tac-toe game using the min-max algorithm. The program for the tic-tac-toe game was developed by
kylie ying whose github is: https://github.com/kying18/tic-tac-toe . Implementation, testing and designing the program was mainly done by me while documentation and research was done by
my partner Emily Chamberlain.
